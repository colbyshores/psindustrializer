* Play in a background process.
* Implement sample rate changing
* Add an ability to process external sound files using created object
* Maybe better interface (with pictograms?) for extra functions (presets save and load, file saving/loading)
  I'll return to this later, when there will be more buttons.
* LV2 plugin for direct integration into MIDI+audio pipelines
* On current CPUs it seems possible to do (pseudo-)realtime simulation, so we can just render as we go
